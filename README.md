# dpp
This is a an easily understandable **decimal** floating-point library library for non-critical tasks and testing. The library does not adhere to any particular standard, but was inspired by [DEC64](https://github.com/douglascrockford/DEC64).
# alternatives
* [Boost.Multiprecision](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision) - artisanal c++, highly recommended,
* [DEC64](https://github.com/douglascrockford/DEC64) - legendary asm, one 64-bit type,
* [decimal_for_cpp](https://github.com/vpiotr/decimal_for_cpp) - c++, fixed-point, bloated (locales),
* [libdecnumber](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/tree/master/libdecnumber) - epic c, supported by gcc, complex, huge.
