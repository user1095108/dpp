This is a sample decimal floating point library for testing purposes. The library does not adhere to any particular standard. My goal was to write an easily understandable library, that anyone could fix. For quick decimal jobs.  
The test image was generated by [smallpt](https://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/), using 64-bit decimal floats.
