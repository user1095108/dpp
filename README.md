# dpp
This is a sample decimal floating point library for testing purposes. The library does not adhere to any particular standard. My goal was to write an easily understandable library for quick decimal jobs, that anyone could fix.
The first test image was generated by [smallpt](https://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/), using 64-bit decimal floats. The second test image was generated by julia.cpp, using 32-bit decimal floats.
