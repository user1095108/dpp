This is a an easily understandable **decimal** floating point library library for non-critical **decimal** jobs and testing. The library does not adhere to any particular standard.

The first test image was generated by [`smallpt.cpp`](https://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/), adapted to use 64-bit decimal floats. The second test image was generated by [`julia.cpp`](https://github.com/user1095108/dpp/blob/master/julia.cpp), using 32-bit decimal floats.
