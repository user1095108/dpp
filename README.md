# dpp
This is a an easily understandable **decimal** floating point library library for non-critical tasks and testing. The library does not adhere to any particular standard.

The first test image was generated by [`smallpt.cpp`](https://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/), adapted to use 64-bit decimal floats. The second test image was generated by [`julia.cpp`](https://github.com/user1095108/dpp/blob/master/julia.cpp), using 32-bit decimal floats.
# alternatives
* [DEC64](https://github.com/douglascrockford/DEC64) - legendary asm, one 64-bit type,
* [decimal_for_cpp](https://github.com/vpiotr/decimal_for_cpp) - uninspired c++, fixed-point, bloated (locales),
* [libdecnumber](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/tree/master/libdecnumber) - epic c, supported by gcc, complex, huge.
